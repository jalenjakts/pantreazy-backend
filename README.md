# Pantreazy NodeJS API

Welcome to the Pantreazy NodeJS API for SWE 4724. This project utilizes the NextJS Framework to handle the component-based web application that we need to manage the website.

This application currently right now does not have the application deployed to AWS. This README will document all the necessary information need to build and get started with the application.

These are the list of applications needed to run and test the applications.
1. [Install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Preferred Text Editor: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
3. Optional Text Editors include: [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/download) and [Atom](https://atom.io)
4. Yarn Package Manager - this can also be used instead of the Node Package Manager (NPM)

- Run the following command for the yarn package manager:

### How to Install Package Dependencies for the Project
This is how you will get the expo, react, react-native projects:

- Execute the following command:
    
`npm install` - This will install all the package dependences from package.json file

### How to Start Up Project
Like stated in the description, this project can be ran in several ways. I'll go through each of the different ways that the application can be ran.

1. After cloning the repository to your system. Create a new branch as your name to carry out work separately from the master branch.
2. Switch to your branch, and now you're good to develop and code on the project.
3. Open up your terminal and cd into your current directory for where the project is.
4. You will need to ask the original developers to provide you the information for the .env file
5. Within the terminal run the following command:

- Execute the following command:

`npm run dev`
